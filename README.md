This is my implementation of a 3D rendering engine in python, using PyGame and Numba (Numba is necessary in order to speed up the rendering functions).

# Features:
- textured .obj file rendering
- basic object management
- box colliders
- (somewhat janky) physics engine

# Gallery:

images of the engine in action will be posted here
